To keep the oe-qky-dunfell repo on github as small as possible, 
The "src" folder is not here.

Please download it from here (248MB):

https://distro.ibiblio.org/easyos/source/extra/oe-qky-dunfell/src.tar.gz

md5sum: e68a79396e44244a2c5572815fe2f921

And expand it inside the "oe-qky-dunfell" folder (alongside "quirky" folder):

# tar -xf src.tar.gz

"src.tar.gz" contains source tarballs that libreoffice requires during compile.
If they aren't provided, then the libreoffice build will download them,
except won't download the translations tarball.

Ok, you don't have to download it. Script "create-oe-quirky" will download it,
if folder "src" doesn't exist.

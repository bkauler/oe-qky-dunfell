those patches 0XX-*.patch, I created from here:
https://github.com/wdlkmpx/osmo/commits/master
my local work is at /mnt/sda1/downloads/downloads2/input570/0-osmo/0-source
have not yet applied these to the recipe.

note, osmo was crashing when create a new contact, see my blog post:
https://bkhome.org/news/202104/osmo-crash-fixed.html
however, wdlkmpx determined that crash is due to libgtkhtml, see patch
I have added to that recipe.
